Base9 is an educational language runtime and programming language! Weâ€™re using it to show people how to use [Eclipse OMR] to build their own language runtime with a Just in Time (JIT) Compiler! The base9 front-end language is a simple subset of JavaScript. For more information, visit the [base9 website], or see a complete listing of the [base9 documentation].
